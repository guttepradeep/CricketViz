IPL Data Analysis Using Pandas and Matplotlib
**CricketViz: IPL Data Analysis Project In this project, I analyzed IPL (Indian Premier League) data using Python's Pandas for data wrangling and Matplotlib for creating insightful visualizations. Key highlights include:

Data cleaning and preparation to ensure accurate analysis of match statistics.
Analysis of individual player performances, team success rates, and match outcomes to uncover trends such as leading scorers and bowlers.
Visualizations created with Matplotlib to effectively present trends like team performance over seasons, player contributions, and match outcomes. This project enhanced my ability to work with large datasets, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and develop clear, actionable insights using visual storytelling.**
